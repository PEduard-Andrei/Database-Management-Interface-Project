### What could be improved:

- Encrypt the admin key. The admin key is in the source code as a "demo".

- Improved dashboards with graphs and statistics.

- Notification system, for example alerts when the stock is low, unpaid invoices.

- Add Mobile Support.

- API integrations.

- Backup system implemented in cloud.
